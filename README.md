An ESLint plugin for enforcing rules and ensuring consistency in Tailwind CSS.
This project is similar to [eslint-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/francoismassart/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss),
but since that plugin does not provide direct support for Svelte, this project
was created to fill the gap.

See the installation and rule documentation in the [`docs/` folder](./docs).
